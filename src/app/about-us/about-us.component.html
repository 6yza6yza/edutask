      relevant bodies, authorities and education institutions in Kosovo in different historical periods.
      The archive collects documents in print and in electronic format from different periods in order to

      communities of practice and authors free of charge and accessible to all.
      The preservation of documentary heritage in the field of education was and is still affected by changes
      in the administration of education throughout history, consequences of war, archiving practices and
      broken website links. Many important documents are not easily accessible for the general public and
      researchers, jeopardizing the collective memory preservation.
